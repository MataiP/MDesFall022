      <h4>Week 14</h4>

        <h3>Prompt:</h3>
       
        <p>Will you make it for your own personal use or more general, usable by a larger group of people? Is it mean for solo performance or multiple people? Will it be specific to a genre of music? How do you select the parameters that you can manipulate, how do the ergonomics and the process of playing affect the layout and the functionality?</p>
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p> I would've liked to make this to experiment with interactive art instillations. Probably around trying to combine sound with the movement of the gallery viewers. Tracking parameters from the light sensor and range indicator to know how close people stand from piece and present different tracks. Tracks around more ambient sound.</p>
        <li> I wasn't able to complete this assignment since it stop working, and I wasn't able to figure out how to fix it. Also with parts of my hardware (the range indicator) not being compatiable with the ESP2 Feather Board(requires 5v). </li>
